abstract = {Language learners often use subtitled videos to help them learn the language. However, standard subtitles are suboptimal for vocabulary acquisition, as translations are nonliteral and made at the phrase level, making it hard to find connections between the subtitle text and the words in the video. This paper presents Smart Subtitles, which are interactive subtitles tailored towards vocabulary acquisition. They provide features such as vocabulary definitions on hover, and dialog-based video navigation. Our user study shows that Chinese learners learn over twice as much vocabulary with Smart Subtitles than with dual Chinese-English subtitles, with similar levels of comprehension and enjoyment.},

abstract = {This work implements multiple language acquisition hypotheses in the form of software. The Input Hypotheses by Krashen [19] are applied in the form of a Google Chrome browser extension. The language acquisition hypotheses are explored and used to extract functional requirements to create a new language learning tool. The resulting tool presents such features as personalized learning, translating phrases in context in-place inside web pages, and supporting more than 100 languages.},

abstract = {Language learners often use subtitled videos to help them learn. However, standard subtitles are geared more towards comprehension than vocabulary learning, as translations are nonliteral and are provided only for phrases, not vocabulary. This paper presents Smart Subtitles, which are interactive subtitles tailored towards vocabulary learning. Smart Subtitles can be automatically generated from common video sources such as subtitled DVDs. They provide features such as vocabulary definitions on hover, and dialog-based video navigation. In our pilot study with intermediate learners studying Chinese, participants correctly defined over twice as many new words in a post-viewing vocabulary test when they used Smart Subtitles, compared to dual Chinese-English subtitles. Learners spent the same amount of time watching clips with each tool, and enjoyed viewing videos with Smart Subtitles as much as with dual subtitles. Learners understood videos equally well using either tool, as indicated by self-assessments and independent evaluations of their summaries.},

abstract = {Watching video is an increasingly popular way of learning foreign language. However, learning through normal play mode encounters many problems such as diverting learning attention, fast switching subtitles and lacking review motivation. We purpose InteractiveSubtitle, a video language learning method with multi-mode interactive study process. We complete UI design of each mode and conducted a survey on InteractiveSubtitle. The results indicate that InteractiveSubtitle gets good acceptance and has the potential to become an efficient language learning tool.},
