\begin{abstract} 
  The ability to learn a new language is directly related to the user's disposition and comfort for better interaction with learning platforms. This facilitates the gamification of language learning, thereby reducing its level of exhaustion. The process of learning a new language typically commences with activities such as writing, reading, listening, and speaking. This work involved creating an application that facilitates language learning by utilizing a movie streaming platform with subtitles, allowing users to watch movies with the original audio and subtitles and focus on keywords or frequently repeated words for better comprehension. The work is based on the premise that to understand a text, you don't necessarily need to know the whole formation but rather just the keywords or most repeated words, allowing you to apply skimming and scanning techniques. To record these words in the user's memory, gamified forms of Spaced Repetition System (SRS) can be applied to induce the user to better adapt to each scenario in the future based on their current repertoire. By following this approach, users can enhance their experience while watching movies or videos to acquire knowledge of a new language. \\

\section{Introduction} 

Mastering a new language is undeniably valuable, yet it's often accompanied by challenges such as waning motivation and a sense of discomfort. What if there was a way to transform language acquisition into an engaging and less taxing experience? Imagine users effortlessly learning while enjoying themselves. 
In parallel, watching movies and series is a common activity and enjoyable; streaming platforms have become a popular source of entertainment. A huge number of people use those platforms to train or learn a new language using subtitles and audio.
Studies demonstrate that students acquire a new language at double the speed using a similar learning mechanism called smart subtitles \cite{Kovacs13}. Thus, it is feasible to infer that approaches involving entertainment platforms can also be practical for learning, especially when utilizing subtitles from these platforms. \\
The fusion of these concepts has the potential to help language learning, making it more engaging and less taxing. This work is about the creation of an application that allows users to learn a new language or expand their vocabulary in a gamified and interactive manner using streaming platforms.

\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation arises from the need to find alternatives to make learning a new language more exciting and efficient. The conventional language learning method can be tiresome and demotivating for many students. \\
By creating an environment that allows interaction with streaming sites for movies, learning a new language can be done more naturally and playfully, similar to tools that translate web pages to facilitate learning or understanding of other languages already present in the market or research area \cite{ElBatanony21}. \\
By watching movies with audio and subtitles in the original language, the user can learn while applying gamified SRS techniques to memorize new words. In succinct terms, the motivation for this work is to provide an efficient and attractive alternative for learning new languages.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The traditional method of learning a new language can be exhausting and demotivating for many students. A more playful and interactive approach to learning new languages is necessary to make the process more enjoyable and efficient. 
To illustrate this, we notice that the current learning method creates a massive flow of giving up; an empirical example is "only 55, or 19\% of 286 Year 11 students reported that they intended to continue studying the language after age 16. The four most frequently cited reasons for not continuing were (a) that they did not enjoy it (35 students), (b) it was difficult (25 students), (c) it was of no use for their planned career (23 students), and (d) they were not good at it (20 students)" \cite{Graham1}. 

\subsection{General goals}

This work aims to develop an application that allows users to learn a new language or expand their vocabulary in a gamified and interactive manner. The extension will be designed to interact with movie streaming sites, leveraging the available subtitles on these sites to aid in the teaching process. \\
The work is based on the premise that learning a new language more efficiently and satisfactorily is possible when gamified and interactive. Additionally, it is based on a similar methodology - smart subtitles - which has been effective in expanding vocabulary \cite{Kovacs14}. \\
Thus, the goal is to offer a different and efficient approach to using subtitles so that people can learn new languages and expand their vocabulary while watching their favorite movies in a relaxed and effective way.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
The work aims to achieve the following specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop browser extensions, a website, and an application accessible to users interested in language learning.
\item Implement functionality in the browser extensions, website, and application to interact seamlessly with streaming platforms for accessing subtitles.
\item Establish and maintain a comprehensive database of keywords for each target language, alongside user progression tracking.
\item Provide translation services for keywords, aiding users in comprehension.
\item Utilize gamified Spaced Repetition System (SRS) techniques to facilitate the memorization of new vocabulary.
\item Enable users to select their preferred language for learning.
\item Offer detailed progress statistics to users, including metrics such as the most challenging words and total words learned.
\item Support multiple languages through AI integration, providing a diverse learning experience.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Methodology}
To achieve the work's objectives, in this article we followed a methodology based on the following steps:
The first step was a literature review and gathering references for similar works or theoretical foundations to turn language learning into a more playful and interactive experience. \\
The second step was the study of methods for user training to improve the user's progress and how to manage the user information, including their progression in learning to make the learning process more efficient. \\
The third step was to build a prototype based on the previous steps, to test the idea and the user experience. 
Additionally, it examines big companies like Duolingo, Memrise, Busuu, Lingoda, Drops, and especially Language Reactor, which are the most popular language-learning platforms, to understand how they work and how to improve the user experience. \\

\end {itemize}

\subsubsection{Approach to Goal Attainment}

The development process for the extension, site, and app involves distinct steps to achieve the overarching goal. While some steps are common across all environments, each has its unique set of tasks to accomplish the goal. \\
The development of the extension was based on the following requisites:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identification of streaming sites with available subtitles for movies.
\item Development of a subtitle extraction tool.
\item Integration of the extension with streaming sites.
\item Create a script to show iframe with the application site.
\item Development of teaching logic based on captured subtitles.
\item Implementation of SRS technique to gamify learning new languages.
\item Create ways to communicate between the extension, site, streaming sites, and app.
\item Integrate the extension information with the site and app.
\end{enumerate}
The site: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Development of the site's graphical interface.
\item Development of the site's teaching logic based on captured subtitles.
\item Implementation of SRS technique to gamify learning new languages.
\item Create ways to communicate between the site, extension, streaming sites, and app.
\item Integrate the site information with the extension and app.

\item Development of the app's graphical interface.
\item Show the iframe with the application site.
\item Create a way to communicate between the site and the app.
\item Create a way to store site information.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Difficulties and Challenges}
The main difficulties and challenges encountered during the application development were related to integrating the extension with streaming sites and developing the teaching logic based on captured subtitles. The extension's integration with streaming sites required using the browser's internal messaging services, a new and complex feature to work with. Developing the teaching logic was also challenging, as it needed to use Spaced Repetition System (SRS) techniques to gamify learning new languages. This requires a deep understanding of SRS techniques, which data was necessary to store, and how to store it. \\
The secondary difficulties were related to the development of the site and app, as it required a deep understanding of and applying those technologies to the work, like the iframe, web channels, and others. \\
Lastly, it is hard to create an excellent graphical interface that is responsive and fast, so that the user can understand and use it without any problems. The work's current focus is to make it easier to operate, but it lacks some visually appealing interfaces.


\section{Theoretical Referencial}
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of subtitled videos as a way to assist in the learning of foreign languages. However, standard subtitles are not ideal for vocabulary acquisition, as translations are non-literal and are provided only for phrases, not individual words. \\
To overcome this problem, "Smart Subtitles" have been developed, interactive subtitles focused on vocabulary acquisition. "Smart Subtitles" includes features such as vocabulary definitions when hovering over with the mouse cursor and video navigation based on dialogue \cite{Kovacs13}. Studies have shown that students learn more than double the vocabulary with "Smart Subtitles" compared to Chinese-English dual subtitles, with similar levels of comprehension and satisfaction \cite{Kovacs14}. \\ 
Another approach to assist in the learning of foreign languages is the use of browser extensions. The browser extension "InteractiveSubtitle" \cite{ElBatanony21} is an example of this. The extension features personalized learning, translation of phrases in context on web pages, and support for over 100 languages. The goal is to utilize various hypotheses of foreign language acquisition to create a new language learning tool that is more effective. \\ 
Based on these ideas, an application has been proposed that utilizes "Smart Subtitles" to train users through gamified practice before watching a subtitled movie in a language they are learning. The application also aims to include features such as interactive exercises to reinforce vocabulary acquisition and games to help users. 
Also, to improve the user commodity, an app and a site were proposed to not necessarily use a computer to study, providing a way for the user to study on every device. 
\section{Software Design}
The application core (the method of teaching) is based on the articles by Kov√°cs et al. \cite{Kovacs14}, which use the premise of subtitles to advocate for a more playful and immersive learning method. This demonstrates the potential of such approaches for language learning and how more playful and intelligent approaches directly influence learning new words, as exemplified in Figure-\ref{fig:my_label}. \\

The work utilizes techniques used by El Batanony et al. in their article "A browser extension to facilitate language acquisition" \cite{ElBatanony21}, making the beginning of the development a case study of their article, observing the approach they used to create an extension that interacts with web pages.  \\
Using Spaced Repetition System (SRS) techniques to gamify learning new languages based on the premise that knowledge of keywords or the most repeated ones allows for text comprehension. \\
Created using modern technologies, including JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Prisma, Nextjs, PostgreSQL, and Web Channels. This work also utilizes the browser's internal messaging services to integrate the extension with streaming sites. The extension works with Prime Video, but the goal is to expand to other platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and others. \\
The technologies were chosen based on the need to create a fast and efficient application with a good user experience and an excellent database to store user information and progression. Nextjs is a frontend and backend that has a big community and is very fast, having a good integration with Prisma, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that is easy to use and has a good amount of users with PostgreSQL database. \\
At this point in the prototype creation, an environment to learn a new language was built, including a browser extension, a site, and an app, all integrated and working together to provide a better experience. \\
The diagram provided in Figure \ref{fig:database_diagram} illustrates the intricate structure of the database employed in this work. It meticulously outlines the relationships between various tables, providing a comprehensive overview of how user data and language information are organized and interconnected within the system. \\
The Container diagram, depicted in Figure-\ref{fig:container_diagram}, offers a detailed visualization of the application's architecture, delineating the interactions between different components such as the extension, site, and app. This diagram showcases the technological framework utilized and elucidates how these components collaborate to facilitate seamless communication and functionality. \\
The figure-\ref{fig:context_diagram} is a context diagram that was built to create this environment. Where we could see the core of the system using an IA provided by openAI, to generate translations, meanings, and games. Each one of the environments has its own functions and responsibilities. The extension is responsible for capturing the subtitles and opening the modal with the iframe, the site is responsible for storing the data and providing the games, and the app is responsible for showing the site inside the iframe and sending the user information to the site. \\
To be more visible the process of the games and word data acquisition, the figure-\ref{fig:flow_diagram} illustrates it. This flow was selected with a focus on optimizing speed due to the substantial volume of data involved, along with the associated costs of utilizing AI. \\
Presently, the AI of choice is the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model developed by OpenAI, incurring costs of \$0.0010 per 1K tokens of input and \$0.0020 per 1K tokens of output. Leveraging a database for storing data offers greater flexibility, particularly since the input remains constant. This approach ensures that when a user learns a word in a specific language and transitions to another, the necessary information about games and the word parameter are retrieved from the AI only once. 
\section{Results}
A browser extension was developed that interacts with movie streaming sites and extracts the subtitles available on these sites. The extension uses Spaced Repetition System (SRS) techniques to gamify learning new languages based on the premise that knowledge of keywords or the most repeated ones allows for text comprehension. The goal is to expand to other platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and others. \\ 
The site was also developed to provide statistics on user progress, including the most challenging words, the total words learned, and others to help the user understand their learning process. The site also supports multiple languages, which allows users to learn a wide range of languages using AI translations and the creation of games.  \\
The app was developed to provide a way for the user to study on every device, displaying the iframe with the application site.\\
This work has demonstrated the potential of using technology to facilitate language learning. Integrating our tool with everyday activities such as watching movies can make language learning more engaging and compelling. 
\subsection{Interface}
As a result, each environment has its functions and responsibilities, and based on that it needs a different interface(resources) to have a better responsibility and user experience. And improve the features that each environment possible. The user can interact with the application with the ambient mobile and browser, using the app, site, or extension. Each interface is different and has different layouts and features to improve the user experience. 
\subsubsection{site}
The module of the site has an interface that adjusts to the user's device. The site is the base of the extension and app, and those use an iframe to show the site. The design is based on long and small screens to support the user in every device. The site also provides a way to communicate with the extension and the app, and the user can access the site to continue training the words from the streaming platform. Some examples of ways to interact with the application are:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Languages Page: where the user started to learn, the possible movies to study, and the movies that the user has started, as demonstrated in the figure-\ref{fig:site1}.
\item Language List: A List of languages that the user can learn, as demonstrated in the figure-\ref{fig:site2} and in the mobile version in the figure-\ref{fig:app2};
\item Profile Page: The user profile with progress for each language, as demonstrated in the figure-\ref{fig:site3}.
\item Languages by Movie: A list of languages when the user selects a movie, as demonstrated in the figure-\ref{fig:site4}.
\item Games Page: A list of possible games that the user can play, as demonstrated in the figure-\ref{fig:site5}.

\subsection{Future Improvements}

For future improvements, there are subsections for each one and each environment (extension, site, app, backend, and AI) to improve the prototype. Because this work is a prototype, the goal is to improve the user experience and the learning process,  make the application more responsive and fast, create a better interface, improve the user experience, and reduce costs to maintain the application.

\subsubsection{Extension}
The extension needs to be some refactors to turn more responsible and fast, because the background service that takes the subtitles is slow and executes a cronjob to get the subtitles. Is necessary to study ways to do this using dispatch events and workers. \\
Currently, the repertoire of sites is so small that the extension could communicate, and restrict only to Prime video, but the goal is to expand to other platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and others. \\
Also is important to create a WebSocket to extract pieces of information from the site, considering that some streaming uses another technology to show the subtitles. \\
Considering that is possible to create communications between extensions or sites, a discussion about the possibility of integrating with other tools like Language Reactor, is viable.


\subsubsection{Site}
The site is the core of the application and is necessary to improve the user experience and make it more responsive. The site will be expanded to include new features like interactive exercises and games to reinforce vocabulary acquisition. \\
About the games, is necessary to create a better interface and improve the user experience. Because the games are the part visible at the core of the learning process, the user needs to have a good experience to continue using the application. The site was created without a professional designer, and games are the part that needs more attention in design. \\
The entire site needs to be more responsive and fast so that the user can understand and use it without any problems. The UX is missing, and the site needs to be redesigned. \\
Levels, interests, and other user information are not being used to improve the user experience, and the site needs to be customized to the user's level and interests, providing an interactive and engaging learning environment. \\
The last part about UX is the current language of the site, which is not possible to change the site language and is a relevant part of improving the user experience. \\
More about technology is interesting to associate the site with the WebSockets also, and create new channels to communicate with mobile and notify the user to study like a reminder. 
\subsubsection{App}
The app will be improved to capture device information and send it to the iframe to make it more responsible and fast. This possibility sends to the backend that information and creates a dashboard or extract to discover the user behavior and how to improve it. \\
The channel to communicate with the site to possibly configure notifications is also an important feature, because a huge part of the users use the app to study, and the app needs to remember the user to do this. 
\subsubsection{Backend} 
On the backend, the API routers will be improved using workers because the data will be extensive, and the app and site will be faster and more responsive. \\
Some API routers will be improved using workers because the data will be extensive, and the app and site will be faster and more responsive. \\
As the data of each word is a complex process a solution is to build routines to run at night that will recalculate the user progress and the word level based on the results of all users.
Another important part is the language manager, that will be changed using only the language name, not the language code. \\
And the last part is the web sockets, which will be created to improve communication between the extension and the site, and the site and the app. 

\subsection{AI}
The AI of choice is the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model developed by OpenAI, incurring costs of \$0.0010 per 1K tokens of input and \$0.0020 per 1K tokens of output. The goal is to reduce costs. Enhance prototype performance and stabilize monthly payments by leveraging proprietary AI technology. Considering the adoption of Smaug-72B-v0.1, an advanced open AI model known for surpassing the capabilities of my current paid AI solution. The transition to utilizing in-house AI will occur when it becomes more advantageous than relying on third-party APIs.


\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this work has successfully developed a browser extension, a website, and an app that aim to facilitate language learning by extracting subtitles from movie streaming sites. The extension utilizes Spaced Repetition System (SRS) techniques to gamify language learning, while the website provides statistics on user progress and supports multiple languages. The app allows users to study on any device. \\
Moving forward, several steps are planned for each application component. The extension will be expanded to other streaming sites, languages, and platforms and it will be integrated with other language-learning tools. The website will include interactive exercises, games, and customized learning experiences. The app will capture device information and improve communication with the website. \\
In addition, the application's backend will be enhanced with improvements to API routers and to the language manager. Web sockets will improve communication between the extension and the website. \\
Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using technology to make language learning more engaging and accessible. By integrating language learning with everyday activities like watching movies, users can enhance their language skills in a fun and interactive way.
