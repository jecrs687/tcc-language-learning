  abstract  = {Language learners often use subtitled videos to help them learn the language. However, standard subtitles are suboptimal for vocabulary acquisition, as translations are nonliteral and made at the phrase level, making it hard to find connections between the subtitle text and the words in the video. This paper presents Smart Subtitles, which are interactive subtitles tailored towards vocabulary acquisition. They provide features such as vocabulary definitions on hover, and dialog-based video navigation. Our user study shows that Chinese learners learn over twice as much vocabulary with Smart Subtitles than with dual Chinese-English subtitles, with similar levels of comprehension and enjoyment.},

  abstract  = {This article reports on the findings of an investigation into the attitudes of English students aged 16 to 19 years towards French and how they view the reasons behind their level of achievement. Those students who attributed success to effort, high ability, and effective learning strategies had higher levels of achievement, and students intending to continue French after age 16 were more likely than noncontinuers to attribute success to these factors. Low ability and task difficulty were the main reasons cited for lack of achievement in French, whereas the possible role of learning strategies tended to be overlooked by students. It is argued that learners' self-concept and motivation might be enhanced through approaches that encourage learners to explore the causal links between the strategies they employ and their academic performance, thereby changing the attributions they make for success or failure.}

Learners spent the same amount of time watching clips with each tool, and enjoyed viewing videos with Smart Subtitles as much as with dual subtitles. Learners understood videos equally well using either tool, as indicated by self-assessments and independent evaluations of their summaries.},

  abstract = {The European Commission's policy aims to foster a language-friendly living environment, where different languages are heard and seen, and where speakers of all languages feel welcome and language learning is encouraged. However, the European Survey on Language Competences reveals that Europeans still need to improve their knowledge of foreign languages and there is a wide range of ability across European countries. Besides the formal language learning, there are several informal approaches that can contribute to foreign language achievement. Several studies suggest that foreign language acquisition may be facilitated by watching subtitled television programmes and movies. In this paper we present and discuss the main advantages of subtitling regarding foreign language acquisition, as well as outline suggestions through which foreign language achievement may be enhanced. A bibliographical review about the effects of subtitling on the learning of foreign languages was conducted. Furthermore, some results from cross-national surveys, such as the European Survey on Language Competences (ESLC) will be presented.}

  abstract = {Understanding foreign speech is difficult, in part because of unusual mappings between sounds and words. It is known that listeners in their native language can use lexical knowledge (about how words ought to sound) to learn how to interpret unusual speech-sounds. We therefore investigated whether subtitles, which provide lexical information, support perceptual learning about foreign speech. Dutch participants, unfamiliar with Scottish and Australian regional accents of English, watched Scottish or Australian English videos with Dutch, English or no subtitles, and then repeated audio fragments of both accents. Repetition of novel fragments was worse after Dutch-subtitle exposure but better after English-subtitle exposure. Native-language subtitles appear to create lexical interference, but foreign-language subtitles assist speech learning by indicating which words (and hence sounds) are being spoken.},

Photos can also be gathered and organized via personal lifelogs and social media websites which may include contextual metadata such as location, participants, rating, and even emotional tags. However, memories and connections between places, events, and people can be difficult to recollect. Memory recall in our brain can depend on several factors: emotional level, context variability, loss of information during encoding, etc. As time passes, memories are gradually forgotten or become altered, e.g. due to collision with newly encoded information [Yi Chen 2010].},

  abstract  = {Spaced repetition is a mnemonic technique where long-term memory can be efficiently formed by following review schedules. For greater memorization efficiency, spaced repetition schedulers need to model students' long-term memory and optimize the review cost. We have collected 220 million students' memory behavior logs with time-series features and built a memory model with Markov property. Based on the model, we design a spaced repetition scheduler guaranteed to minimize the review cost by a stochastic shortest path algorithm. Experimental results have shown a 12.6\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. The scheduler has been successfully deployed in the online language-learning app MaiMemo to help millions of students.},

  abstract  = {In the study of human learning, there is broad evidence that our ability to retain information improves with repeated exposure and decays with delay since last exposure. This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-off between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-off is spaced repetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in electronic flashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we mine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory model to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a queueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing flashcards, along with a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for review scheduling. Finally, we empirically evaluate our queueing model through a Mechanical Turk experiment, verifying a key qualitative prediction of our model: the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.},
